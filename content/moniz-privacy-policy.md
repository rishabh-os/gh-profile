# Moniz Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how Moniz (the "App") collects, uses, and protects your data. Because Moniz is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), the code is publicly available for review, which allows for greater transparency.

## Data Collection

Moniz collects the following data:

**Crash Reports:** When the App crashes, anonymized crash reports are generated and sent to Sentry (sentry.io). These reports help us identify and fix bugs. These reports may contain information about your device model, operating system version, and the state of the App at the time of the crash. They do not include personal information that could identify you. You can learn more about Sentry's data processing practices [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** We collect anonymized usage statistics using PostHog (posthog.eu). This data helps us understand how Moniz is being used and improve its functionality. This data is anonymized and does not identify you personally. You can learn more about PostHog's data processing practices [here](https://posthog.com/privacy).

## Data Use

Any data collected by Moniz is used solely for the purpose of improving the App and fixing bugs. We do not sell your data to third parties.

## Data Sharing

We share anonymized crash reports with Sentry for the purpose of improving Moniz's stability. We share anonymized usage statistics with PostHog to understand how Moniz is used. We will never share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on the code repository. Your continued use of Moniz following the posting of such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
